# COVID-Predictions
Data Science Final Project

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and two other teammates. 
It is broken down into three main parts:
  First the collection and preparation of the data
  Second a linear model prediction for upcomming months
  Third a time-series prediction for the upcomming months
  
The model was trained using data from March - October and was tested initially on November, then the model was adjusted to use March - November to predict the number of cases in December.
